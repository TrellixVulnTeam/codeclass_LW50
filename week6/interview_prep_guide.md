Things you have to pay for, but possibly helpful as you practice:

## A Typical Technical Interview Process

0. Call with a recruiter or hiring manager. Discuss who you are, what the role is, etc.
Similar to non technical interviews
1. 60min phone or video screen (typically a little simpler questions, basically can you code and
discuss code at all)
2. On-site interviews: 5-7 sessions, 45min-60min each. (That's right it's a full day!) Usually,
most of the interviews will have you write code on a whiteboard or on a loaner laptop. One or
two of the interviews will be higher level problem solving discussions. And one or two are just
looking at interpersonal/work history/communication/social fit kinds of things.
