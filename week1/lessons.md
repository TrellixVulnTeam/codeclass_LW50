## Week 1, Day 1

**Primary Reading**: [CS4All Chapter 1](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforallbook/Introduction/Introduction.html),

**Discussion Reading**: [Coding is Not the New Literacy](https://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/), [Please don't learn to code](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/)

**Discussion Questions**: How is a programming language different than a spoken language? What is the difference between “coding” and “modeling”? Between “programming” and “computer science”?

**Exercises**:
Solve the empty room and maze picobot maps: [https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/)
(diamond and stalactite rooms are bonus) Debrief at the end of class.


## Week 1, Day 2

Note: In retrospect, I would save this for later and give people more time this week to get used to
python syntax.

**Primary Reading**: [What is a Finite State Machine?](https://medium.com/@mlbors/what-is-a-finite-state-machine-6d8dec727e2c), [Understanding state machines](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/state-machines-basics-of-computer-science-d42855debc66),

**Discussion Reading**:
 [railroad block signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signalling#Block_signalling), [An example of state machine modeling](https://engineering.checkr.com/doubling-our-volume-while-increasing-reliability-checkrs-state-machine-83a8fd042a43),

**Discussion Questions**: (After the exercises) What are the strengths and limitations of FSMs? What makes Picobot a FSM? What would we need to be able to solve all the picobot maps?

**Exercises:**
 Use [http://www.madebyevan.com/fsm/](http://www.madebyevan.com/fsm/) to draw some Finite State Machine models: Model a traffic light, a vending machine, try to think of something else to model on your own. Can you model the pico bot simulator as an FSM? [Orientation to python part 1.](install_python.md)


## Week 1, Day 3

**Primary Reading**: [CS4ALL Chapter 2 through section 2.6](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforallbook/FunctionalProgramming/functionalprogramming.html)

**Discussion Reading:** [Boeing Max crash](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html),

**Discussion Questions**: What does it mean for a program to be “correct”?

**Exercises**: [Orientation to python part 2](install_editor.md),
[Four Fours](four_fours.md), [Rock-paper-scissors](rock_paper_scissors.md)

**Aphorism**: "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence" - Edsger Dijkstra

**Discussion Reading:** Play [towers of hanoi](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-tower-of-hanoi) until you have the hang of how to solve it (feel free to google the strategy if you’re stuck)

**Discussion Questions**: We’ll discuss recursion in class and work through towers of hanoi solution

**Exercises**: [Function Frenzy](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/FunctionFrenzyGold), [Recursion Rocks](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5Fall07/RecursionRocks)
