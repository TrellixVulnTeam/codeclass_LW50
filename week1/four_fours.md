# Four fours!

(Taken from https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/Orientation)

Try to compute _16 of the 20 values_ from 0 through 20 using _exactly four fours_. (We ask for only 16 so that you can skip a couple if they give you trouble!)
Eg. `print("Zero is", 4+4-4-4)`

* You may use any of Python's arithmetic operations:
    *   `+` addition
    *   `-` subtraction or negation
    *   `*` multiplication
    *   `/` division
    *   `(   )` parentheses for grouping
    *   `**` power

*   Results with decimals: 1.0, 2.0, etc. are totally ok!
*   You may also use 44 or 4.4, each of which count as two fours,
*   or .4, which counts as one four.
*   or, sqrt, for example sqrt(4) (or others)
*   or, factorial, for example factorial(4) (or others)
*   both sqrt and factorial are from Python's math library
*   aside: the line from math import * is what imports that math library...

Here are what the results, _but not the source code_, will look like.
Remember you need only 16 of them:

```
Zero is 0
One is 1
Two is 2
Three is 3
Four is 4
Five is 5
Six is 6
Seven is 7
Eight is 8
Nine is 9
Ten is 10
Eleven is 11
Twelve is 12
Thirteen is 13
Fourteen is 14
Fifteen is 15
Sixteen is 16
Seventeen is 17
Eighteen is 18
Nineteen is 19
Twenty is 20
```

You may find the four fours game addicting, or frustrating, or both! Hint: the power operator is helpful!
