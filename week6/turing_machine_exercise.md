Programming a Turing Machine
----------------------------

A Turing machine lets us model what kind of problems are computable
and how their time and space requirements grow as a function of the
input size. While somewhat cumbersome for solving problems in practice
a Turing machine can do anything that the most powerful computers can do.

## Simulator
Open https://turingmachine.io/ and read the discription for the
 'divisible by three' machine and the simulator in general. Step through
the input and see how it works.


## Exercises
1. Program a machine to write 1101001 to the tape,
2. Program a machine to determine if a binary number is divisible by two
3. Look at one of the more complicated machines (eg. binary addition)
to see if you can understand it.
